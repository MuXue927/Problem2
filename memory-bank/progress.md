Status Overview
Memory Bank initialized (core six documents). ALNS heuristic pipeline, adaptation layer, and reporting stack implemented. Column Generation (CG) prototype present but flagged for correctness review. Monolithic baseline code available for reference.

Implemented Components (High-Level)
- Data ingestion: DataALNS (validation, dtype coercion, derived mappings)
- State management: SolutionState (objective(), validate(), penalties, cost computation)
- Operators (Destroy): random, shaw, periodic_shaw (class-based), worst, infeasible, surplus_inventory, path, ml_based_destroy (conditional)
- Operators (Repair): greedy, inventory_balance, urgency, infeasible, local_search, LearningBasedRepairOperator, ml_based_repair (conditional)
- Adaptation: ParamAutoTuner (performance tracking, param adjustment)
- ML Layer: MLOperatorSelector (feature extraction, periodic training, encoding)
- Search orchestration: ALNS integration (selection via SegmentedRouletteWheel, acceptance via SimulatedAnnealing)
- Stopping: Combined criteria (iterations + runtime)
- Tracking: ALNSTracker (iteration stats, callback integration)
- Output & Reporting: CSV artifacts (results, summaries, diagnostics), plots (objective, gap, operator performance), param tuning reports, inventory & capacity diagnostics
- Logging: File-based logging + LogPrinter formatting

Outputs Generated (Per Run)
- opt_result.csv, opt_details.csv, opt_summary.csv
- non_fulfill.csv (unmet demand), extra_volume.csv (capacity violations)
- sku_inv_left.csv (inventory time series)
- images/* (objective, gap, operator usage/performance)
- param_tuning_report/* (adaptive / ML performance snapshots)
- alns_optimization.log (iteration log + diagnostics)

Quality / Testing Status
Current Tests:
- Initial solution & core feasibility (partial coverage)
Gaps:
- Operator regression & performance stability
- ML selector correctness / convergence behavior
- Stress tests for large horizon instances
- Headless plotting configuration (Agg backend)
Planned Remediation:
- Convert return-based tests to assert patterns
- Introduce ML feature schema & validation tests
- Add CI workflow (editable install, deterministic seed check, coverage threshold)

Known Issues / Risks
- CG model correctness uncertain (treat as experimental)
- Infeasible initial solutions possible; termination controlled by config
- ML effectiveness dependent on sufficient training samples (cold start)
- Scaling: Large instances may hit runtime cap before iteration cap
- No standardized run manifest (reproducibility metadata partially implicit)

Open Technical Debt
- Lack of formal operator catalog & parameter semantics document
- Missing performance benchmark suite (baseline objective references)
- Limited ML feature engineering (expand inventory slack / temporal dynamics)
- No structured persistence layer for multi-run comparative analytics

Backlog / Roadmap (Short to Mid Term)
1. CI pipeline (GitHub Actions): setup venv → install -e . → headless tests → artifact publish (logs + coverage)
2. Test modernization: assert conversion, coverage expansion
3. Operator catalog (descriptions, expected effects, tunable params)
4. Run manifest JSON (seed, config values, operator set hash)
5. ML feature schema doc + potential feature store abstraction
6. CG model audit & refactor or deprecation decision
7. Performance profiling (pyinstrument) targeting high-cost operators
8. Add no-improvement stopping criterion (optional)
9. Enhanced parameter evolution visualization (temporal trends)

Immediate Next Steps (Post-Initialization)
- Decide priority between CI pipeline vs operator catalog
- Implement headless plotting backend config in test harness (Agg)
- Begin test refactor (return → assert)

Change Log (Session Initialization)
- Added projectbrief.md (scope, objective, success metrics)
- Added productContext.md (stakeholders, workflows, value proposition)
- Added systemPatterns.md (architecture, patterns, extensibility)
- Added techContext.md (dependencies, configuration, tooling)
- Added activeContext.md (current focus, risks, near-term plans)
- Added progress.md (status ledger & roadmap)

Metrics to Start Tracking (Future)
- Gap decay rate (slope over windows)
- Operator usage entropy (diversity metric)
- Average improvement per operator family (rolling window)
- ML retrain cost vs iteration wall-clock delta
- Feasibility recovery curve (violations count trend)

Status
Memory Bank base layer COMPLETE. Ready for iterative refinement aligned with roadmap execution.
